"""
Reintegration-focused utilities:

- availability processes (e.g. 2-state Markov masks),
- availability-history counters and transforms,
- evaluation helpers for reintegration-window metrics.

These modules are designed to be wired into `fed_multimodal` training and
evaluation code from extension scripts, keeping upstream code largely intact.
